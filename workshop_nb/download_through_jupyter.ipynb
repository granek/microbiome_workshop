    "Another way to download files is through scp and sftp, these are secure file transfer protocols.  Command line versions come built in on OS X, as long as you don't mind using the.  There are also GUI versions of scp and sftp, such as [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) and [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/).  These are both cross platform and free.  For these you would use the same hostname, username, and password that you used to SSH to your virtual machine.\n",
