    "This past week a paper came out from a combination of the QIIME developers and the developers of some recent OTU clustering methods: [Open-Source Sequence Clustering Methods Improve the State Of the Art](http://msystems.asm.org/content/1/1/e00003-15). In this paper, several new and open source methods (Swarm, SUMACLUST, OTUCLUST) are compared to the standard methods in the field (QIIME/uclust, mothur, UPARSE).\n",
    "\n",
    "As the developer of [an open source method for inferring sample composition from amplicon sequencing](http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2015/08/06/024034), this presents an ideal opportunity to compare the accuracy our method, DADA2, to the \"state of the art\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To briefly recap, DADA2 is a method to infer the sample sequences in a collection of amplicon sequencing reads. DADA2 is a de novo method, and completely reference free. DADA2 does not create OTUs, it infers sample sequences exactly, resolving differences of as little as one nucleotide. DADA2 is an open-source method implemented as [an R package available here](http://http://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/).\n",

    "For the even dataset, DADA2 detected **every one** of the 1,055 unique sequence variants, including those differing by just 1 nucleotide, more than any other method (957-1049). DADA2 reported 0 False Positives (amount unreported for other methods, but probably significant for some). DADA2's estimated abundances were essentially perfect, and just 5/106,700 sequencing reads were misassigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the staggered dataset, DADA2 identified 1,042/1,055 unique sequence variants, more than any other tested method (949-1035). DADA2 again output 0 False Positives (amount unreported for other methods, but probably significant for some). DADA2's 13 False Negatives were all very low abundance (1-5 reads, <0.01% frequency). DADA2's estimated abundances were extremely accurate (cor > 0.9999).\n",
    "\n",
    "Simulated data without chimeras is the easiest possible case, and performance on such data is not guaranteed to translate to real sequencing datasets. That said, none of the algorithms tested in this paper approached DADA2's level of accuracy. Tested at the \"OTU\" level, DADA2's F-score on the Even dataset is 1, and on the Staggered dataset is 0.994.\n",

    "### Mock Communities\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Bokulich 1688 (or Bokulich_6) dataset, DADA2 output 64 sequence variants, closer to the expected number of 48 strains than any other method (many of which reported >1000 OTUs). At the genus level, DADA2 identified 25/26 expected taxonomies, with the one missed taxonomy likely being absent from the sequencing data. DADA2 identified 6 unexpected genera, all of them low abundance (<0.5\\%) and all of them exact BLAST matches to nt -- these are all likely correctly identified contaminants. DADA2's Fscore at the genus level was `r getF(exp.1688, genus.1688)`, higher than any other tested method (0.45 - 0.61).\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Bokulich 1685 (or Bokulich_2) dataset, DADA2 output 175 sequence variants, closer to the expected number of 18 strains than any other method. At the genus level, DADA2 identified 18/18 expected taxonomies. DADA2 identified 11 unexpected genera, all of them extremely low abundance (<0.01\\%) and all of them with a BLAST match of >99\\% identity to nt -- these are all likely correctly identified contaminants. DADA2's Fscore at the genus level was `r getF(exp.1685, genus.1685)`, higher than any other tested method (0.39-0.54).\n",
    "\n",
    "The default application of DADA2 was already more accurate than any of the other tested methods on Bokulich 1685, but with one extra step of using the provided diagnostics, and thereby deciding to not call single-nucleotide variants, DADA2 output 39 sequence variants, an almost error-free collection of the expected strains and contaminants. None of the algorithms tested in this paper approached this level of accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accuracy and DADA2\n",
    "\n",
    "Common tools, including many of those tested in the paper [Open-Source Sequence Clustering Methods Improve the State Of the Art](http://msystems.asm.org/content/1/1/e00003-15), report thousands of OTUs from amplicon sequencing data performed on mock communities of tens of strains due to inadequate treatment of PCR and sequencing error. This biases estimates of diversity, lowers the power of subsequent analysis, prevents the effective resolution of low-frequency variants, and limits amplicon studies to characterizing shifts in broad taxonomic groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown above, our method DADA2 improves on both the sensitivity and specificity of commonly used methods, detecting both more real variants and (far) fewer spurious ones. This difference can be dramatic: The common QIIME/uclust pipeline reports 20,084 OTUs in an 18-strain mock community, ~20,000 of which are spurious. In comparison, DADA2 without SNVs reports just 39 sequence variants, which consist of the 18 expected strains, a handful of contaminants, and ~5 spurious sequences. Of note, this dramatic reduction in spurious output is achieved without imposing aggressive filters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Accurate analyses start with accurate data, and [DADA2](http://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/) improves the accuracy of amplicon sequencing data by powerfully separating sequence errors from true biological diversity.\n"
