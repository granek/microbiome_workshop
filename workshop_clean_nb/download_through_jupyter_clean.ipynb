Using the following command will create a package file (commonly called a tarball) containing all of the notebook files in the current directory.  \n",

    "Another way to download files from the virtual machine is through scp and sftp, these are secure file transfer protocols.  Command line versions come built in on OS X, as long as you don't mind using the.  There are also GUI versions of scp and sftp, such as [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/) and [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/).  These are both cross platform and free.  For these you would use the same hostname, username, and password that you used to SSH to your virtual machine.\n",

    "\n",
    "### GitHub Repository\n",
    "All of the above methods will download files from your virtual machine as they are now (i.e. with any changes you have made).  If you want the orginial notebooks, as well as additional material that went into developing this workshop, you can [download a zip file](https://github.com/granek/microbiome_workshop/archive/master.zip) containing the whole [GitHub Repository of this workshop](https://github.com/granek/microbiome_workshop)"
