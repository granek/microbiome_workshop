    "We use R in our lessons because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  we have to use *something* for examples;\n",
    "2.  it's free, well-documented, and runs almost everywhere;\n",
    "3.  it has a large (and growing) user base among scientists; and\n",
    "4.  it has a large library of external packages available for performing diverse tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "But the two most important things are\n",
    "to use whatever language your colleagues are using,\n",
